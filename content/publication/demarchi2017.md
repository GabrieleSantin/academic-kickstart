title: "A rescaled method for RBF approximation"
author_list: S. De Marchi, A. Idda, G. Santin
abstract: "In the recent paper [8], a new method to compute stable kernel-based interpolants has been presented. This rescaled interpolation method combines the standard kernel interpolation with a properly defined rescaling operation, which smooths the oscillations of the interpolant. Although promising, this procedure lacks a systematic theoretical investigation. Through our analysis, this novel method can be understood as standard kernel interpolation by means of a properly rescaled kernel. This point of view allow us to consider its error and stability properties."
