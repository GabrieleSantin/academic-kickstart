abstract: "We propose a novel kernel-based method for image reconstruction from scattered Radon data. To this end, we employ generalized Hermite--Birkhoff interpolation by positive definite kernel functions. For radial kernels, however, a straightforward application of the generalized Hermite--Birkhoff interpolation method fails to work, as we prove in this paper. To obtain a well-posed reconstruction scheme for scattered Radon data, we introduce a new class of weighted positive definite kernels, which are symmetric but not radially symmetric. By our construction, the resulting weighted kernels are combinations of radial positive definite kernels and positive weight functions. This yields very flexible image reconstruction methods, which work for arbitrary distributions of Radon lines. We develop suitable representations for the weighted basis functions and the symmetric positive definite kernel matrices that are resulting from the proposed reconstruction scheme. For the relevant special case, where Gaussian radial kernels are combined with Gaussian weights, explicit formulae for the weighted Gaussian basis functions and the kernel matrices are given. Supporting numerical examples are finally presented."
