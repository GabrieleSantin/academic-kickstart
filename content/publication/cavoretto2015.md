abstract: "We present an algorithm to approximate large datasets by Radial Basis Function(RBF) techniques. The method couples a fast domain decomposition procedure with alocalized stabilization method. The resulting algorithm can efficiently deal with largeproblems and it is robust with respect to the typical instability of kernel methods."
