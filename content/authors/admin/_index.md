I'm a Researcher in the [MobS Lab](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/mobs/) at the [Center for Information and Communication Technology](https://ict.fbk.eu/) of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Trento (IT).

I work with the [RSDE](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/rsde/) and [DCL](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/dcl/) labs to develope Machine Learning solutions and algorithms for the exploitation of different data sources and modeling techniques within the "City Sensing" project.

I'm also a junior partecipating researcher in the Cluster of Excellence [Data-integrated Simulation Science](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), where I'm a member of the Project Network [Machine Learning for Simulation](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/networks/6/).

Previously, I've been for four years in the [group of Bernard Haasdonk](https://www.ians.uni-stuttgart.de/anm/) at the University of Stuttgart, working on kernel based algorithms and their application to the surrogate modelling of complex simulations.

I obtained my MSc and PhD at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Padova under the supervision of Stefano De Marchi in the [CAA group](https://www.math.unipd.it/~marcov/CAA.html), where I wrote my theses on algorithmic and theoretical aspects of kernel based interpolation.
